# Data science snippets

## What's the purpose?

This repository contains code snippets and some scripts that I found useful when tackling data science problems. The aim for this repository is to provide simple that can be read and used very quickly, without finding the answer in the internet.
  * [pretty printing of container classes](./printable_class)
  * [running notebooks that generate data](./running_notebooks)
  * [random number generation](./random_number_generation)

## Contribution guide

Do you have an idea what could be improved or implemented? Open an issue, or even better, create a pull request! Each snippet should be in a separate subdirectory, with clean, copy-pastable code accompanied
by an example.
